## Profile
#### Difficulty
- 3-Start-Challenge

#### Category:
- Improper Input Validation

#### Description
- Register as a user with administrator privileges.

#### Hints from OWASP Juice Shop itself
- You have to assign the unassignable.

#### Hints from the Developer Akademie
- For this challenge, create a new account in the OWASP Juice Shop. To do this, use the email address `kazuto@kirigaya.sao`. This account should have the same permissions as the admin account `admin@juice-sh.op`.
    >i: I misspelled the domain name horribly. I called registered the user under: `kazuto@kirigaia.saop`
- The following questions will help you solve the challenge:
    - How do you determine whether you are an `admin` or a `customer` when you register?
    - How does the response you receive after registration help answer the first question?

## What do you need to solve the challenge?
- **OWASP Juice Shop**
    - registration page `http://127.0.0.1:3000/#/register`
- **Burpsuite** - <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp">Click here for more information</a>
    - Proxy Server
    - HTTP history
    - Intercept mode

## Solution
### Step 1: Register a dummy user and have a look at the HTTP response
- If you want to use the HTTP response to find out how a newly registered user is classified as `admin` or `customer`, it is best to register a dummy user and look at the response using Burpsuit.
    - Open a terminal, start **Burpsuite**, navigate to the **Proxy** section and open the **Proxy Browser**.
    - Open in this browser the **Owasp Juice Shop** and navigate to the **registration page**: 
        - `Login > Not yet a customer? > User Registration` or
        - `http://127.0.0.1:3000/#/register`
    - Fill out the form with dummy data and click the *Register-Button* to register the dummy user.

### Step 2: Examine the HTTP response
- Switch to the Burpsuite window and have a look in the **HTTP history** tab.
- <ins>What do you see?</ins> 
    - On the left side there is the registration POST request with the dummy data. 
    - On the right side there is shown the response. The dummy data was expanded, among others things, with the parameter: `"role": "customer"`.

- <ins>What does that mean?</ins>
    - The parameter `role` defines the user status.
    - There must be a way to specify it when registering.

### Step 3: Specify the parameter `role` when registering
- Fill out the register form with the given data and then **STOP!!!**

- Before clicking the *Register Button*, switch on the **Intercept mode** in the Burpsuite window to intercept the data that the form will send.
- Find the payload and add the parameter `"role": "admin"`:

    <img alt="new_payload" src="https://github.com/SarahZimmermann-Schmutzler/juice_shop_challenges/blob/main/admin_registration/new_payload.png"></img>  

- Forward the request until it is done.
- Change to the **HTTP history** tab and have a look at the response:
    - The parameter was successfully added to the user account. The user kazuto has the status `admin`.

    <img alt="response" src="https://github.com/SarahZimmermann-Schmutzler/juice_shop_challenges/blob/main/admin_registration/response.png"></img>  

- The OWASP Juice Shop gives the following feedback with confetti:
    - `You successfully solved a challenge: Admin Registration (Register as a user with administrator privileges.)`

### Step 4: Check the success
- Login with the user data of user `kazuto` and browse to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/#/administration`.
    - Only users with admin status have access to this page.

## Summary
In this challenge there is given a scenario of **Improper Input Validation** leading to a so-called **Privilege Escalation**.   
The user's entries in the registration form are not checked before they are further processed. Using Burpsuite, it was possible to intercept the HTTP request and manipulate it - adding the key-value pair `"role":"admin"` to the payload - so that the user gets administrative priviliges. Actually, this parameter is not entered via the input mask. By default, each user is set a `"custumer"` status.  
Developers bear the primary responsibility for preventing and fixing such vulnerabilities - Ensuring roles and permissions are controlled server-side and implementation input validation and security reviews. Users have limited options - They only can report the vulnerability if they find one and avoid insecure platforms.
