## Challenge Overview
#### Difficulty
- 3-Star-Challenge

#### Category:
- XSS (Cross-site Scripting)

#### Description
- Perform a persisted XSS attack with ```<iframe src=\"javascript:alert(`xss`)\">``` bypassing a client-side security mechanism.

#### Hints from OWASP Juice Shop itself
- Only some input fields validate their input. Even less of these are persisted in a way where their content is shown on another screen.

#### Hints from the Developer Akademie
- Using the payload ```<iframe src=\"javascript:alert(`xss`)\">```, ensure that the administrator receives the following message in the *administration section*:  
<img alt="alert" src="https://github.com/SarahZimmermann-Schmutzler/juice_shop_challenges/blob/main/client_side_xss_protection/alert.png"></img>

- Select a suitable source and sink. To do this, take a close look at the administration section and think about what could have triggered the message.

## What do you need to solve the challenge?
- **OWASP Juice Shop**
    - Access to an account with admin status
    - Administration page `http://127.0.0.1:3000/#/administration`
- **Burpsuite** - <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp">Click here for more information</a>
    - Proxy Server
    - Intercept mode
    - HTTP history

## Solution
### Step 0: What is XSS?
- This task is about **persistent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**:
    - The attacker permanently stores malicious code on the server, e.g. in a database.
    - When users visit the infected site, the malicious code is automatically executed.
    - <ins>Example</ins>: An attacker posts a crafted script on a forum that runs every time another user reads the post.

### Step 1: Login with admin status and examine the admin section
- First of all the administration section needs to be examined. **Login** at the **OWASP Jucie Shop** with the admin account or an user account that has admin status to unlock the administration page:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:3000/#/login
    ```
    - In the task `Admin Registration` a user was registered with admin status, so this account can be used:
        - <ins>Email</ins>: `kazuto@kirigaia.saop`
        - <ins>Password</ins>: `abc123`
    - If this task isn't done yet, use the admin account. In the two-star-challenge `Password Strength` the password was cracked via SQL Injection so it is known:
        - <ins>Email</ins>: `admin@juice-sh.op`
        - <ins>Password</ins>: `admin123`

- Switch to the **administration page** that is now unlocked:  
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:3000/#/administration
    ```
    - <ins>What do you find here?</ins> The page shows the `Registered Users` and the `Customer Feedback`.

### Hypothesis: It has to be placed at the **Customer Feedback**!
- Looking at **Step 0** the `Customer Feedback` feels like the perfect source to put the payload.
- <ins>But it turns out, no</ins>. The JavaScript code could be placed in the feedback form but the server-side validation works as it should and filters out the code.  
<img alt="feedback_form" src="https://github.com/SarahZimmermann-Schmutzler/juice_shop_challenges/blob/main/client_side_xss_protection/feedback_form.png"></img>  
<img alt="feedback_request_and_response" src="https://github.com/SarahZimmermann-Schmutzler/juice_shop_challenges/blob/main/client_side_xss_protection/feedback_response.png"></img>


### Step 2: Placing the payload at the Registered Users via the **Registration Form**
- First it looks like the wrong path too: Because of the safety precautions taken, placing the payload diretcly in the **Registration Form** is not possible.
- Choose the indirect route to place the payload in the request:
    - Open **Burpsuite** and the **Proxy Browser**
    - Browse to the **OWASP Juice Shop's register page**:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:3000/#/register
    ```
    - Fill in some dummy-data. Before clicking the *Register Button*, switch on the **Intercept mode** in the Burpsuite window to intercept the data that the form will send.
    - Find the request payload and change the parameter `"email": "your_dummy@data"` to ```"email": "<iframe src=\"javascript:alert(`xss`)\">"```  
    <img alt="payload" src="https://github.com/SarahZimmermann-Schmutzler/juice_shop_challenges/blob/main/client_side_xss_protection/payload.png"></img>
    - Forward the request until it is done and confetti appears.
    - Change to the **HTTP history** tab and have a look at the response. It adopted the entered payload as the email address:
    <img alt="payload_response" src="https://github.com/SarahZimmermann-Schmutzler/juice_shop_challenges/blob/main/client_side_xss_protection/payload_response.png"></img>


### Step 3: Check the success
- Go back to the administration page (not proxy server) and refresh it. The JavaScript code runs correctly - an **alert window** appears and its message says: `xss`.  
<img alt="popup" src="https://github.com/SarahZimmermann-Schmutzler/juice_shop_challenges/blob/main/client_side_xss_protection/popup.png"></img>

- The table of the Registered User looks like this:  
<img alt="table_registered_user" src="https://github.com/SarahZimmermann-Schmutzler/juice_shop_challenges/blob/main/client_side_xss_protection/table.png"></img>

- And the the details of the xss-User like that:  
<img alt="details_xss_user" src="https://github.com/SarahZimmermann-Schmutzler/juice_shop_challenges/blob/main/client_side_xss_protection/details.png"></img>

## Summary
In this challenge there is given a scenario of **XSS - Cross-Site Scripting**. A JavaScript code should be placed in a proper source causing the popup of an alert window every time the administration page is opened.    
      
The **registration form** turned out to be a suitable source. Although the client-side validation works (you cannot submit the form with the malicious code), there is no server-side validation, which is why the payload that was injected into the request using Burpsuite is processed by the server. What do we learn from this?
- **Client-side validation alone is not secure**. It can be easily bypassed because the client (browser) is under the attacker's control.
- **The server is the final authority of security**. Every input must be checked and processed on the server side.
- **Layers of protection measures are ideal**: client-side validation for ease of use, server-side validation for security, and additional mechanisms such as output encoding and CSP for comprehensive protection.
  
An `<iframe>` is normally used to embed external content (such as another web page or a resource) into a web page. As seen here, the javascript schema can also be used so that inline JavaScript code is executed directly in the `src attribute of the <iframe>-tag`. That means in a real attack, `alert('xss')` could be replaced with more malicious code, e.g. to steal cookies or redirect to a phishing site.  
**As a user, you can protect yourself** against attacks such as XSS and similar security issues by observing certain behavioral and technical protection measures. Here are some tips:
- Only enter personal information on trusted sites.
- Avoid clicking on links in suspicious emails or on dubious websites.
- Modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox or Edge implement CSP rules on websites. Keep your browser up to date so that these protective mechanisms are effective.
- Install trusted extensions like uBlock Origin or NoScript that can block scripts and filter out unwanted content.
- Use a VPN, especially on public networks, to increase the security of your data.
- Delete cookies regularly or use the browser in private mode to reduce the risk of cookie theft.
